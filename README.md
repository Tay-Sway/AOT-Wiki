# Attack on Titan Wiki Project

This project displays information from the Attack on Titan API, including character data, episode info, and military regiments. Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data fetched using API calls.

## Files Overview

### `fetch-helpers.js`

- Fetches data from the Attack on Titan API using functions like:
  - `fullAotCharactersList()`: Gets all characters.
  - `fetchEpisode()`: Gets episode info.
  - `militaryImgs()`: Gets military organization images.
  - `mainCharactersImg()`: Gets main characters' images.
  - `characterListPage()`: Handles pagination for character lists.

### `dom-helpers.js`

- Manages DOM manipulation to display the fetched data:
  - `trainingCadetImg()`, `scoutRegimentImg()`, etc., display military images.
  - `introBio()`: Renders character bios.
  - `renderPageList()`: Renders character lists from different pages.

### `style.css`

- Provides mobile-first styling for the project:
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes.
  - Sections for main characters, military divisions, and tabs.
  - Basic styling for background, spacing, and layout.

### `main.js`

- Imports functions from the other files and coordinates the data fetching and display:
  - Fetches character, episode, and military data.
  - Calls rendering functions to display the data on the page.

## How it works:

1. **Fetching Data**: API calls fetch data for characters, episodes, and images.
2. **Displaying Data**: Data is displayed on the page using DOM manipulation.
3. **Styling**: The page is styled to be mobile-first and responsive.
4. **Main Script**: `main.js` controls the flow, ensuring everything is fetched and displayed correctly.
